               webserver.py
           written by Claude Pageau

This is a stand alone web server.

Please Note
You will need at least two entries in a folder
before the web server will display content.
IMPORTANT: Use browser refresh to update files list
then select a list hyperlink since 
config.py default web server settings are 

web_page_refresh_on = False
and
web_page_blank = True

If a folder is selected on the right pane listing
the folder contents will appear in existing browser tab.
Select the < BACK link on Right panel listing to
navigate back to previous folder. < BACK will not
be displayed when in web server root folder.	 
Use browser refresh to update web page and display most
recent data.

This web server can display other types of content
but html files will be displayed full screen.
Web pages with javascript, css Etc will run.
If a folder has an index.html it will take over
the browser tab.
This browser can only access local raspberry pi
files. It cannot access internet web pages.
